define('TXT_BELIEVE-THIRULLUVAR_MSG-DIRECTOR','I believe, as <strong>THIRULLUVAR</strong> does, in the Virtue and Morality of Life, The Wealth of Man, in Love and Passion, and in the sentimental and psychological values of life. He presents, through his verses, Unity in Diversity and the Art of living.');
define('TXT_BELIEVE-SOCRATES_MSG-DIRECTOR','I believe, like <strong>SOCRATES</strong>, in the practice of dialogue. It appears that we now have to start from scratch: we should become like contemporaries of Socrates who in the streets of Athens and in the public square, chatted with those around him. He discussed what constitutes the value of a human life, what motivates a particular individual or a civic action, and the goals that are pursued by the individual and the community at large. His thought, based on a dialogue which admits plurality and tolerance, encourages us to rediscover the universal principles that would lead humanity towards greater fraternity and cooperation in order to better live together. Dialectize or Philosophize is to understand that “reality” is at the same time unique and multiple, one and many, and that after having been fragmented, the gathering together will allow one to go within and return to oneself.');
define('TXT_BELIEVE-RABELAIS_MSG-DIRECTOR','I believe, as <strong>RABELAIS</strong> and <strong>MONTAIGNE</strong>, in a general and humanistic education. No one understood like Montaigne that, before teaching a specialist trade, it is imperative to develop in each individual the faculties that make people human. Montaigne promoted his doctrine of education which is neither austere in its goals nor rigorous in its processes but rather is consistent with the nature and the natural development of the student. It is applied primarily to refine a critical thinking process tending towards happiness through the serenity of soul and the lucidity of mind.');
define('TXT_ACCEPT_MSG-DIRECTOR','I accept the considerations of <strong>CONDORCET</strong> as he ponders about:  How can one reconcile in a school setting, the unity and social diversity of children? How to uniformly transmit, in a socially diverse national environment, a minimum of knowledge, moral sentiments, and identical basic skills, to all members of a republic. How is it possible to prevent the knowledge and information of some elites turning into absolute power over others?');
define('TXT_BELIEVE-EINSTEIN_MSG-DIRECTOR','I believe, like <strong>EINSTEIN</strong>, in an education for free and holistic thinking. It is not enough to teach man a speciality because he would then only become like a usable machine devoid of personality. It is important to acquire an emotional intelligence and a sense of what type of professional practice is worthwhile to be undertaken, what is good, decent, and respectable, AND what is morally right. Otherwise, as it can be with professional knowledge, he is more like a trained dog than a harmoniously developed human being. The holistic man must learn to understand the motivations of men, their dreams and their anxieties in order to determine his exact role vis-à-vis his family and the community.');
define('TXT_QUOTE_MSG-DIRECTOR','To quote his citation : The excesses of the competitive system and premature specialization under the false pretext of efficiency, kills the spirit, prohibits the development of cultural life and even suppresses progress in forward-looking sciences. It is also important in order to achieve a perfect education, to develop critical thinking in the mind of the young man. Or, overloading the brain with a system or note taking, hinders and necessarily transforms research into a superficial activity lacking Culture. Education should be as follows: the person who receives it treasures it as a priceless gift but never as a painful constraint.');
define('TXT_ASK_MSG-DIRECTOR','I ask, as <strong>Ken ROBINSON</strong> does, why modern education doesn\'t try to get the best out of people? This is because we have been educated to become good workers rather than creative thinkers. Students with restless minds and bodies – far from being cultivated for their energy and curiosity – are ignored or even stigmatized with terrible consequences. "We are educating people outside of, and not respecting, their creativity potential."');
define('TXT_AGREE_MSG-DIRECTOR','I agree with <strong>SAINT-EXUPERY</strong> who said, "To know is not to show or explain. It is to gain access to the Vision.”');
define('TXT_BELIEVE-PEOPLE_MSG-DIRECTOR','I believe that very many people end their lives with no idea of what their talents are or could have been. On one hand, I have to recognize that the development of human potential is not a mechanical process but rather an organic one. On the other hand, I believe that our only hope for the future is to adopt a new concept of human ecology, one where we would begin to rethink our ideas about the wealth of human potential. Our education system has strip-mined our minds in the same way that we have exhausted the earth: for a specific resource.');

We also believe that the harmonious growth of the society of human beings, in constructive interaction with the rest of the universe, is of essential importance within a vision that recognizes the ecological integration of humans and humanity in the broader context.<br> <br>That belief is furthermore based on the assumption that the capacity of humans to reflect upon themselves and on their relations with their environment, dispositions them uniquely to play a critical role in how the world evolves. We see ahead of us incredible potential, the wise use of which can benefit all of humanity and the habitat on which it thrives and to which it contributes, as well as the possibility of total decline and eventual self-destruction. We see learning as having everything to do with the human ability to live on the edge and thus to keep local and global systems in dynamic equilibrium, providing them with the best abilities for co-evolutionary growth. <br> <br>Within the framework of the above vision, the prime goals of <strong>Sustainable Development Management Institute </strong>are :');

define('TXT_PROGRAM_PRESENTATION','In pursuing the above goals, <strong>Sustainable Development Management Institute</strong>  will engage in activities that are directly linked to these goals. It may also undertake activities that are only indirectly connected to them. <br><br><strong>Sustainable Development Management Institute</strong> sees it as its responsibility to continually develop its internal consciousness about how its strategies and actions relate to its vision, mission and goals. In addition, it undertakes to clarify this position in transparent ways to its partners, clientele and sponsors and seeks to involve them in this process. It is conscious of the desirability to always be as constructively critical of its own vision and the ways it tries to implement it as of the thoughts and actions of others. It therefore adheres decidedly to the idea that the best way for it to play its role is by applying to itself the principles it also advocates to others : those of organizational learning. <br><br>');
define('TXT_PROGRAM_PRESENTATION','The above position has implications for how <strong>Sustainable Development Management Institute</strong> cares for itself and its resources. Such care, as expressed in sound administration and management of resources (financial and otherwise), will never be an end in itself.

Within that context, it will be conscious of both itself and its environment and seek to develop them together in a balanced manner. In other words, while money will have to be charged for services provided, this will be done within the spirit of the goals of the organization. Modalities will be sought that take into account the nature of established partnerships and reasonable expectations as to what each can and should contribute and how parties should work together to generate, share and manage the resources required to attend to their shared interests <strong>Sustainable Development Management Institute</strong> is, in this context, particularly concerned with the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities in the world. In working with partners in different circumstances, <strong>Sustainable Development Management Institute</strong> will seek to act in a balancing manner while providing services and being compensated for them.');
